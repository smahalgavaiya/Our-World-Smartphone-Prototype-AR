# Our World Smartphone Prototype AR

Welcome to the codebase for the Our World Smartphone Prototype AR. More documentation will be coming soon...

This is built on top of the OASIS API, which can be found here:<br>

**Summary**

This uses the Unity 3D Game Engine with C# back-end code, this is a geo-location AR game similar to Pokemon Go but much more evolved and has been in R&D, planning, design phase since 2013...

NextGen World Ltd creates next-generation software to help co-create a better world for all. The apps, services, platforms & games we create teach people how to take care of themselves, animals & the planet as well as to come together as one to co-create a better world for everyone.

Our World is an exciting immersive next generation 3D XR/IR (Infinite Reality) educational game/operating system/ascension training platform/social network/ecosystem teaching people on how to look after themselves, each other and the planet using the latest cutting-edge technology. It teaches people the importance of real-life face to face connections with human beings and encourages them to get out into nature using Augmented Reality similar to Pokémon Go but on a much more evolved scale. This is our flagship product and is our top priority due to the massive positive impact it will make upon the world...

Our World will be the first AAA MMO game and 2D/3D Social Network to run on HoloChain and the Blockchain. It will also be the first to integrate a social network with a MMO game/platform as well as all of these technologies and devices together. As with the rest of the game, it will be leading the way in what can be done with this NextGen Technology for the benefit and upliftment of humanity.

Our World is an open world real life simulation game. The smartphone geolocation AR version will have similarities to Pokémon go but with a far more evolved, immersive, and personal feel. It will act as a decentralised distributed crowd sourced replacement to Google Maps/Earth. Each user will create an avatar that will act as their digital twin just as the 3D world acts as a digital twin of the real world. Phase 1 is the AR version which we are aiming to have finished by next year with some help. Phase 2 is the 3D VR Console/Desktop version which we are aiming for 2022/2023, again with help from a team. 

We are just onboarding with Hytha and are exploring synergies with The Game Of Seeds along with integration with the OASIS API so it will be exciting how these two games can be integrated. Our World is like the magic superglue that brings everything together through ONE unified interface, so you no longer need to exit one game to play another or do any other task on the internet for that matter (the operating system part). It really is The Infinite World game that Buckminster Fuller envisioned so many years ago, an infinite game with no borders or ending. We hope to work with others like Clean Planet to integrate the karma system for picking up litter (something that has been integrated into our design since 2013), etc.

The Karma System which is linked to each user’s avatar will act on each users’ actions (in the game and in real life in later versions). For good deeds such as picking up litter, progressing in self-development, helping people, eating healthy, donating to charity etc a user will receive Karma, for bad deeds such as dropping litter, eating unhealthy etc a user will lose Karma. This will plug into SEEDS beautifully because people can earn karma as well as seeds for good deeds.. 😊

The deeds above will evolve as the game progresses and develops, and is not exclusive to the above list, any ideas would be welcomed.

Satellite apps/games/websites that plug into Our World/OASIS API all share the central avatar and can contribute towards you earning karma in the main game, unlocking special abilities and superpowers such as being able to fly, teleport, telekinesis, etc

One of its many aims is to get kids out of their bedrooms and back into nature/parks doing quests (treasure hunts and other creative and team building activities). Such as creating sacred geometry in parks, doing group meditations/yoga, etc to earn additional karma points/seeds. We are developing the Our World smartphone prototype and a large part of the quests in the geo-location/AR game is to get people (especially kids) back into parks where they can find and plant SEEDS, they earn karma for this. They then need to tend to these SEEDS by watering them and nurturing them over time, again earning additional karma. We have a LOT more planned, this is just the tip of the iceberg, we have been designing/downloading this game since 2013!

Kid's today are playing violent games like Call of Duty, GTA etc and we wonder why the world is how it is? With the advent of VR and more and more lifelike graphics this is only going to worsen. So Our World attempts to address this by teaching them the correct life lessons, but it is also for people of all ages, backgrounds... it is a mass anti-brainwashing technology, undoing years of damage done to humanity...

It is to help humanity come together and to put their differences aside so we can all live in harmony with each other and our beautiful planet. You can create anything you can imagine in it similar to MineCraft but on a much more evolved scale, you can play it anyway you wish in a massive open world. The smartphone version is like a massively evolved Pokemon Go so uses AR in parks so for example you look at a tree through your phones camera and the tree will come alive and start talking to you and give you a quest to find its lost children (SEEDS) on a mini treasure hunt plus lots more! :)

You can view your and other people’s aura, chakras, and light quotients in real-time through the Soulfie API (one of the many pieces being integrated). The game will also utilise many other cutting edge NextGen technologies such as real-time facial recognition, eye tracking, hand gestures, motion detection, real time emotional feedback & lots more!

The OASIS API allows everything to talk to everything else including Holochain, Threefold, IPFS, SOLID, ActivityPub, Ethereum, EOS, Telos, SEEDS, HIVE, AVALON, STEEM and many more... 

It is like an abstraction layer over the whole internet, a network of networks to silo bust...

Its true unity consciousness expressed within the technical sphere. The OASIS API is the universal data layer to the new internet and Our World is the universal fully integrated immersive UI layer helping to bring everything together through ONE central portal/UI. You will no longer need to remember many login credentials and be forced to check multiple sources for your social feeds/messages, etc.

Have you seen Ready Player One? The closest thing to it is the OASIS out of that... but that is still only about 40% if that of what Our World is... 

The console/desktop version is a fully immersive VR experience, which will fully integrate with the smartphone version so players can see each other in real-time, again another world first.

The whole world is the Our World team, hence the name... ;-) It is not our project; it is all of humanities...

We also offer FREE training and apprenticeship program with the NextGen Developer Training Programmes.  We will teach you all we know over time and you get to work on this real live commercial codebase rather than wasting time working on throw away dummy apps as most training offers. No previous skills/experience required and is open to everyone, but especially for all disadvantaged people including special needs, homeless, unemployed, prison inmates, kids on the streets etc. We want to help the people the world has forgotten and for people who have stopped believing in themselves, we **BELIEVE IN YOU** and in time you will again too. Everyone has a gift for the world, and we will help you find yours… Find out more by checking out the links below:

If anyone is interested in developing this game/platform, then we would LOVE to hear from you! 😊 There will be opportunities for people to own shares and/or cryptocurrency (as well as other unique perks such as premium locations in both the geolocation and VR versions, personal or business service spotlights, free lifetime access to all premium paid services, massive karma points (allowing your avatar to progress to more advanced stages in the game unlocking new exciting quests, areas to explore & new special abilities/superpowers) plus lots more!) based on the input they are willing to provide.

Thank you and we hope we find interest from people to join us on this exciting incredible journey.
